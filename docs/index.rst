Introduction
------------

Calista is a PHP API that serves the purpose of abstracting data source
(database or other sources) and data items property introspection for the
purpose of exposing an easy-to-use data listing API.

In other words, with Calista, you can plug any data source at the cost of
implementing a simple interface, and benefit from generated HTML administration
screens, streamed performant-wise CSV or Excel exports, along with a Symfony 3
integration.
